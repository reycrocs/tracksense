## 🔍 Project Overview

TrackSense is composed of two interconnected components:

### 🦯 Smart Blind Stick
- **Obstacle Detection**: Employs ultrasonic sensors to identify obstacles and notify the user via vibration and buzzer.
- **Edge Detection**: Utilizes infrared sensors to detect the edges of platforms, stairs, or curbs, providing additional safety by alerting the user when they approach dangerous drop-offs.
- **SOS Functionality**: An emergency button instantly alerts a designated guardian through a connected mobile application.
- **GPS Live Tracking**: Enables guardians to monitor the real-time location of their visually impaired loved ones for added peace of mind.
- **Weather Updates**: Delivers real-time weather conditions to help users prepare for the day.

### 🕶️ AI-Powered Smart Glasses
- **Camera Integration**: Captures images of the environment at the press of a button.
- **AI Visual Recognition**: Transmits the image to an AI model (e.g., OpenAI or Gemini Vision) to analyze and describe the surroundings.
- **Voice Feedback**: Provides real-time audio narration of the visual scene using a text-to-speech engine.
