## 📝 Guidelines

- Organize documents into their respective subfolders.
- Use clear and descriptive filenames (e.g., `final_report_v2.pdf`, `system_architecture.png`).
- Prefer PDF format for sharing and versioning.
- Keep editable/source files (e.g., `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.drawio`) when possible for future revisions.

## 📌 Notes

- Keep this directory updated throughout the development cycle.
- You can add a `changelog.md` or `milestones.md` file here to track key project developments.
